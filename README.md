There are twenty different socks of two types in a drawer in one dark room. What is the minimum number of socks you need to take to ensure you have a matching pair?”

If you pick up three socks, they may be of the same type even if the odds are 50%. Odds never an equal reality. Therefore, the only way to ‘ensure you have a matching pair’ is to pick up at least 11 number of shocks.

**37) How you can make sure that your written code which can handle various kinds of error situation?**\
I can write tests that define the expected error situations.

**38) Explain the differences between a Thread and a Process?**\
A process is instance of the computer program.In a single program it is possible to have one or more threads.

**39) Tell me the difference between an EXE and a DLL?**\
An exe is an executable program while a DLL is a file that can be loaded and executed by programs dynamically. It is an external code repository for programs. As both are different programs, reuse the same DLL instead of having that code in their file. It also reduces required storage space.

**40) What is strong-typing and weak-typing? Which is preferred? Why?**\
Strong typing checks the types of variables at compile time. On the other hand, weak typing checks the types of the system at run-time. Among them, Strong typing is always preferred because it minimizes the bugs.

**41) Describe the difference between Interface-oriented, Object-oriented and Aspect-oriented programming.**\
Interface programming is contract based.
Object-oriented is a way to write granular objects which have a single purpose.
Aspect Oriented Programming is to segregate the code in such a manner that various objects carry the main tasks, and the subsidiary tasks are carried by independent objects.

**42) Why using catch (exception) is always a bad idea?**\
It is a bad idea because:

-   As there is no variable defined, it is not possible to read the exception
-   It’s good to use an exception when you have known exception types.

**43) What type of data is passed via HTTP Headers?**\
Script and metadata passed via HTTP headers.

**44) How do you prioritize requirements?**\
First, you need to design a system by evaluating data structure. Then you should move on to the code structure needed to support it.

Object-oriented design can easily be encapsulated to some degree in component-based design.

**46) When do you use polymorphism?**\
Polymorphism is used when there is a need for override functionality when inheriting class. It’s about shared classes and shared contracts.

**47) What is the difference between stack and queue?**

-   Queue is always First In, First Out
-   Stack is always Last In, First Out

**48) What is essential for testing the quality of the code?**\
According to me, the unit testing framework is essential for testing the quality of the code.

**49) Do you think that the maintenance of software is expensive?**\
According to me, maintenances of software will never be expensive if we are using proper development process.

**50) Give me differences between tags and branches?**\
Tags are for versioning releases which are temporary holding places for doing such thing. However, branches are deleted when those changes are merged into the trunk.

**51) Where is a protected class-level variable available?**\
Protected class-level variables are available to any sub-class derived from the base class.

**52) Is it possible to execute multiple catch blocks for a single try statement?**\
Yes. Multiple catch blocks can be executed for a single try statement.
